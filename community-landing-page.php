					<p>I have contracted on a home in Richwoods and I also would like for you to consider this community if you are looking for a new home in the next 3 to 4 years.  I see Richwoods in 8 years (at projected build-out) defining what the city of Frisco really is.</p>
					<p>We will be in constant contact with all of the builders obtaining the most up to date information regarding lot availability and available homes.  Lawler Park will be the community north of Richwoods and we have already met with the developer and are all working together when they open in projected October. Phillips Creek Ranch is another development that should be on your radar if you are looking for a Master- Planned community in Frisco as well as Austin Ridge.</p>
					<p>To be included on the Updates or if you would like a copy of the Plat Map or any of the builders plans, specs and pricing please enter your information below.</p>
					<p>Feel free to contact us directly for a list of available homes.  And don't forget about our Richwoods Rebate Program!</p>
